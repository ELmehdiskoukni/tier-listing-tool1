# Card Context Menu Verification

## Current State Analysis

### CardContextMenu.jsx - Current Menu Items
The card right-click context menu currently contains only relevant actions for existing cards:

1. **Edit** - Edit card properties (hidden for persona cards in tiers)
2. **Duplicate** - Create a copy of the card
3. **Add Comment** - Add a comment to the card
4. **Show/Hide Card** - Toggle card visibility
5. **Pick another persona** - Replace persona (only for persona cards in tiers)
6. **Change Image** - Change card image (only for image cards)
7. **Remove Image** - Remove image and convert to text (only for image cards)
8. **Delete** - Delete the card

### ✅ No "Create New Card" Option Found
The card context menu does **NOT** contain any "Create New Card" options. All menu items are actions that operate on the existing card that was right-clicked.

### Card Creation Locations (Correct)
Card creation is properly located in dedicated UI elements:

1. **Tier "+" Button** - TierRow.jsx dropdown menu
   - "Create New Card" - Creates a new card in the tier
   - "Competitors" - Import competitor cards
   - "Personas" - Import persona cards  
   - "Pages" - Import page cards

2. **Source Area "+" Buttons** - AddSourceCardModal
   - Add competitor cards
   - Add persona cards
   - Add page cards

## Verification Results

### ✅ Context Menu is Properly Focused
- Only shows actions for the specific card that was right-clicked
- No general creation functions
- All options are relevant to existing cards

### ✅ Card Creation is in Correct Locations
- Tier-level creation via "+" button dropdown
- Source area creation via dedicated "+" buttons
- No creation options in card context menus

### ✅ User Experience is Correct
- Right-click on card → Actions for that specific card
- Click "+" on tier → Create new cards in that tier
- Click "+" in source area → Add new source cards

## Conclusion
The card context menu is already properly designed and doesn't need any changes. It correctly focuses on actions for existing cards and doesn't contain any "Create New Card" options. Card creation is properly handled through dedicated UI elements (tier "+" buttons and source area "+" buttons).
