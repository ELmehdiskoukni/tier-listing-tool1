# Remove Image Functionality Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Remove Image" feature was not working properly:
- It was only removing the image URL but not converting the card back to text type
- Cards remained as 'image' subtype even after image removal
- This caused visual and functional issues where cards appeared broken

## Solution
Fixed the `handleRemoveImage` function to properly convert cards from image type back to text type:

### 1. Updated handleRemoveImage Function (`src/components/TierBoard.jsx`)
**Before:**
```javascript
const handleRemoveImage = async (card) => {
  try {
    await updateCardProperty(card, { imageUrl: null, image: null })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to remove image:', err)
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleRemoveImage = async (card) => {
  try {
    // Remove image and convert card back to text type
    await updateCardProperty(card, { 
      imageUrl: null, 
      image: null,
      subtype: 'text' // Convert from 'image' to 'text' type
    })
    
    // Save version after removing image
    await saveVersion(`Removed image from card "${card.text}"`)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to remove image:', err)
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Card Type Detection Logic
Updated both `Card.jsx` and `CardContextMenu.jsx` to properly detect image cards:

**Before:**
```javascript
const hasImage = card.imageUrl || card.image
const isImageCard = card.subtype === 'image' || hasImage
```

**After:**
```javascript
const hasImage = (card.imageUrl && card.imageUrl !== null) || (card.image && card.image !== null)
const isImageCard = card.subtype === 'image' && hasImage
```

### 3. What the Fix Accomplishes
✅ **Removes only the image**: Card text/name remains intact
✅ **Converts card type**: Changes from 'image' subtype to 'text' subtype
✅ **Preserves position**: Card stays in the same tier position
✅ **Maintains functionality**: Card remains draggable and fully functional
✅ **Updates visual display**: Card shows as text-only after image removal
✅ **Version tracking**: Saves version history for the change

### 4. User Experience
- **Before**: Card with "Google" + logo → Remove Image → Broken card with no image but still image-type
- **After**: Card with "Google" + logo → Remove Image → Clean text card showing "Google"

### 5. Technical Details
- **Database Update**: Updates both `imageUrl` and `subtype` fields
- **State Management**: Properly updates both source cards and tier cards
- **UI Consistency**: Ensures context menu and card display are consistent
- **Error Handling**: Maintains proper error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified
- `src/components/TierBoard.jsx` (updated handleRemoveImage function)
- `src/components/Card.jsx` (fixed image card detection logic)
- `src/components/CardContextMenu.jsx` (fixed image card detection logic)

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. Clicking "Remove Image" on a card with "Google" + logo keeps "Google" text
2. Card remains in the same tier position
3. Card is still draggable and functional
4. Context menu no longer shows image-related options after removal
5. Card displays as a clean text card
