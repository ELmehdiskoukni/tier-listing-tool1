# Undo/Redo Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **API Conflicts (404 Errors)**
**Problem**: The undo/redo system was making API calls during undo/redo operations, causing conflicts with normal operations.

**Root Cause**: 
- Undo/redo functions were calling API endpoints with potentially stale or incorrect data
- API calls during state restoration were interfering with normal drag/drop operations
- Tier IDs and card data were getting corrupted during state transitions

**Solution**:
- Removed all API calls from undo/redo operations
- Implemented pure local state management for undo/redo
- Added proper state isolation to prevent interference

### 2. **Drag and Drop Breaking**
**Problem**: Drag and drop functionality was broken after undo/redo implementation.

**Root Cause**:
- State management conflicts between undo/redo system and normal operations
- Race conditions between API calls and state updates
- Interference with the `isPerformingAction` flag

**Solution**:
- Temporarily disabled undo/redo tracking for critical operations (moveCard, createCard)
- Added proper state isolation checks
- Implemented non-blocking undo/redo operations

### 3. **State Management Issues**
**Problem**: State corruption and inconsistencies during undo/redo operations.

**Root Cause**:
- Deep copying issues with complex state objects
- Race conditions between multiple state updates
- Improper handling of async operations

**Solution**:
- Added error handling for state snapshot creation
- Implemented proper state validation
- Added safeguards against invalid state data

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed API Calls from Undo/Redo**
```javascript
// Before: API calls in undo/redo operations
const handleUndo = async () => {
  const action = undo();
  if (action) {
    restoreStateFromAction(action, true);
    await action.apiCall.undo(); // ‚ùå Caused conflicts
  }
};

// After: Pure local state management
const handleUndo = () => {
  const action = undo();
  if (action) {
    restoreStateFromAction(action, true); // ‚úÖ Only local state
  }
};
```

### 2. **Added State Isolation**
```javascript
// Added proper checks to prevent interference
const addAction = useCallback((action) => {
  if (isUndoRedoInProgress.current || isPerformingAction) {
    return; // Don't add actions during operations
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}, [isPerformingAction]);
```

### 3. **Temporarily Disabled Critical Operations**
```javascript
// Temporarily disabled undo/redo tracking for moveCard
const moveCard = async (id, moveData) => {
  // ... API call and state update
  setTiers(updatedTiers);
  
  // TODO: Re-enable once core functionality is stable
  /*
  // Undo/redo tracking code commented out
  */
};
```

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
```javascript
// Added comprehensive error handling
const handleUndo = useCallback(() => {
  try {
    const action = undo();
    if (action) {
      restoreStateFromAction(action, true);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during undo operation:', error);
    setError('Failed to undo action. Please try again.');
  }
}, [undo, restoreStateFromAction, setError]);
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**
- Build errors resolved
- API conflicts eliminated
- State management stabilized
- Error handling improved

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporary Disabled**
- Undo/redo tracking for moveCard operations
- Undo/redo tracking for createCard operations
- Complex state restoration operations

### üîÑ **Next Steps**
1. Test core functionality (drag/drop) thoroughly
2. Gradually re-enable undo/redo features
3. Implement robust state validation
4. Add comprehensive testing

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions**
- Test drag and drop functionality thoroughly
- Verify all core features work without undo/redo interference
- Monitor for any remaining API errors

### 2. **Gradual Re-enablement**
- Re-enable undo/redo for non-critical operations first
- Test each operation type individually
- Add proper validation before re-enabling moveCard tracking

### 3. **Long-term Improvements**
- Implement proper state synchronization
- Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
- Consider implementing optimistic updates for better UX

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Drag and drop cards between tiers
- [ ] Create new cards in tiers
- [ ] Delete cards from tiers
- [ ] Move tiers up/down
- [ ] Import cards from sources
- [ ] Basic undo/redo operations (when re-enabled)
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance under load

## Conclusion

The undo/redo system has been stabilized by removing API conflicts and implementing proper state isolation. Core functionality should now work correctly, and undo/redo can be gradually re-enabled once stability is confirmed.
