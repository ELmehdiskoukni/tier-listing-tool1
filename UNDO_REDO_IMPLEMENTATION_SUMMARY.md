# Undo/Redo Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Undo/Redo system for the Tier Listing Tool that allows users to quickly reverse and restore recent actions with full state management and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Undo/Redo System
- **Custom Hook**: `useUndoRedo.js` - Manages action history with separate undo and redo stacks
- **State Management**: Tracks complete state snapshots for reliable restoration
- **Action Types**: Comprehensive tracking of all user actions
- **History Limits**: Configurable maximum history size (default: 50 actions)

### 2. UI Components
- **UndoRedoButtons Component**: Modern, accessible buttons with visual feedback
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into main TierBoard interface
- **Visual States**: Disabled states when no actions available
- **Tooltips**: Descriptive tooltips showing what action will be undone/redo

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Undo**: `Ctrl+Z` (standard)
- **Redo**: `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (alternative)
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically disabled when in input fields
- **Cross-platform**: Works on all major browsers and operating systems

### 4. Tracked Actions
The system tracks the following user actions for undo/redo:

#### Card Operations
- ✅ **Move Card**: Moving cards between tiers or within tiers
- ✅ **Add Card**: Creating new cards in tiers
- ✅ **Delete Card**: Removing cards from tiers
- ✅ **Update Card**: Editing card properties
- ✅ **Duplicate Card**: Copying existing cards
- ✅ **Toggle Hidden**: Hiding/showing cards

#### Tier Operations
- ✅ **Add Tier**: Creating new tiers
- ✅ **Delete Tier**: Removing tiers
- ✅ **Update Tier**: Changing tier names or colors
- ✅ **Move Tier**: Moving tiers up/down in order
- ✅ **Clear Tier**: Removing all cards from a tier

#### Import Operations
- ✅ **Import Cards**: Importing cards from Card Sources
- ✅ **Source Card Operations**: Adding/updating/deleting source cards

#### Additional Operations
- ✅ **Comments**: Adding/deleting comments
- ✅ **Images**: Changing/removing card images
- ✅ **Persona Changes**: Picking different personas

## Technical Implementation

### 1. State Management Architecture
```javascript
// Action structure
{
  type: ACTION_TYPES.MOVE_CARD,
  description: "Move card 'Card Name' to Tier A",
  previousState: { tiers: [...], sourceCards: {...} },
  newState: { tiers: [...], sourceCards: {...} },
  apiCall: { undo: () => {...}, redo: () => {...} },
  timestamp: Date.now()
}
```

### 2. Integration Points
- **useTierBoard Hook**: Enhanced with undo/redo functionality
- **API Operations**: All CRUD operations now track actions
- **State Restoration**: Complete state snapshots for reliable undo/redo
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when API calls fail

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Deep Copying**: Efficient state snapshot creation
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old history entries
- **Lazy Loading**: Actions only created when needed
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive state updates

## User Experience Features

### 1. Visual Feedback
- **Button States**: Clear visual indication of available actions
- **Descriptive Labels**: Shows exactly what will be undone/redone
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during undo/redo operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

### 2. Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Maintains focus during operations
- **High Contrast**: Works with accessibility themes

### 3. Intuitive Design
- **Standard Placement**: Undo/Redo buttons in expected location
- **Familiar Icons**: Standard undo/redo symbols
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing UI design
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes

## Implementation Details

### 1. Files Created/Modified
- **New Files**:
  - `src/hooks/useUndoRedo.js` - Core undo/redo logic
  - `src/components/UndoRedoButtons.jsx` - UI component
  - `UNDO_REDO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

- **Modified Files**:
  - `src/hooks/useTierBoard.js` - Integrated undo/redo functionality
  - `src/components/TierBoard.jsx` - Added UI components

### 2. Key Functions Enhanced
- `moveCard()` - Tracks card movement with position restoration
- `createCard()` - Tracks card creation with deletion undo
- `deleteCard()` - Tracks card deletion with recreation undo
- `createTier()` - Tracks tier creation with deletion undo
- `deleteTier()` - Tracks tier deletion with recreation undo
- `updateTier()` - Tracks tier updates with property restoration
- `moveTierPosition()` - Tracks tier movement with reverse movement
- `importCardsToTier()` - Tracks import operations
- `clearTierCards()` - Tracks clearing operations

### 3. Error Handling
- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation when server operations fail
- **State Inconsistency**: Automatic data reload on errors
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery options

## Benefits

### 1. User Productivity
- **Quick Corrections**: Instant reversal of mistakes
- **Experiment Safely**: Try changes without fear of losing work
- **Efficient Workflow**: Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- **Reduced Friction**: No need to manually reverse complex operations

### 2. Data Integrity
- **Complete State Snapshots**: Reliable restoration of all data
- **API Synchronization**: Server state stays in sync with client
- **Consistency Checks**: Validation of restored state
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple recovery options

### 3. Developer Experience
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new action types
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in error handling and validation
- **Documentation**: Clear implementation guidelines

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Features
- **Batch Operations**: Undo/redo multiple actions at once
- **Selective Undo**: Choose specific actions to reverse
- **Action Filtering**: Filter undo history by action type
- **Export History**: Save undo history for later use

### 2. Performance Improvements
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large undo histories efficiently
- **Compression**: Reduce memory usage for state snapshots
- **Lazy Loading**: Load state snapshots on demand
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking undo/redo operations

### 3. User Experience
