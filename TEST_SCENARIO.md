# Test Scenario: Cascade Delete and Version History

## üß™ Testing the New Features

Follow this step-by-step scenario to test the cascade delete logic and version history system.

## Step 1: Initial Setup

1. **Open the application** in your browser
2. **Observe the initial state**:
   - Source area has Competitors, Pages, and Personas
   - Tier board has cards in different tiers
   - Some cards reference source items (e.g., "Google", "Meta", "Apple")

## Step 2: Test Version History

1. **Click "Version History"** button in the toolbar
2. **Verify the modal opens** showing the initial version
3. **Check version details**:
   - Should show "Initial state" as description
   - Should have current timestamp
   - Should be marked as "Current"

## Step 3: Create Some Activity

1. **Add a new card** to any tier:
   - Click the "+" button on a tier
   - Create a card with text "Test Card"
   - Verify it appears in the tier

2. **Import cards from source**:
   - Click the "+" button on another tier
   - Select "Competitors" from dropdown
   - Import "Google" or "Meta"
   - Verify cards appear in the tier

3. **Check version history again**:
   - Open version history modal
   - Should now show multiple versions
   - Each action should have its own version entry

## Step 4: Test Cascade Delete

1. **Delete a source item**:
   - Right-click on "Google" in the Competitors source row
   - Select "Delete" from context menu
   - Confirm deletion

2. **Observe cascade delete**:
   - All tier cards with text "Google" and type "competitor" should disappear
   - This should happen automatically across all tiers

3. **Check version history**:
   - Open version history modal
   - Should see new version: "Deleted source item 'Google' and related tier cards"

## Step 5: Test Version Restoration

1. **Restore an earlier version**:
   - In version history modal, click on a version before the deletion
   - Click "Restore" button
   - Verify the board returns to that state

2. **Test with deleted source items**:
   - Restore a version that had "Google" cards in tiers
   - But "Google" is no longer in the source area
   - **Expected behavior**:
     - Cards should appear but be greyed out
     - Red X icon should appear on these cards
     - Cards should not be draggable
     - Right-click should not work on these cards
     - Yellow warning banner should appear at top

## Step 6: Test Visual Indicators

1. **Verify deleted source indicators**:
   - Cards from deleted sources should have:
     - Reduced opacity (60%)
     - Grey background
     - Red X icon in top-right corner
     - "not-allowed" cursor

2. **Test functionality restrictions**:
   - Try to drag a deleted source card (should not work)
   - Try to right-click a deleted source card (should not show menu)
   - Verify warning message appears at top of board

## Step 7: Test Other Operations

1. **Move tiers**:
   - Use up/down arrows to move tiers
   - Check version history for new entries

2. **Rename tiers**:
   - Right-click tier options menu
   - Edit tier name
   - Check version history

3. **Add new tiers**:
   - Hover over tier rows to see "+" button
   - Add new tier
   - Check version history

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Cascade Delete
- Source item deletion automatically removes related tier cards
- Version history tracks the deletion
- No orphaned cards remain

### ‚úÖ Version History
- All significant actions create new versions
- Versions can be restored
- Current version is clearly marked
- Deleted source items are detected and marked

### ‚úÖ Deleted Source Handling
- Cards from deleted sources are visually distinct
- Functionality is properly restricted
- Clear warning messages are shown
- User understands the situation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If cascade delete doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify source card has matching `text` and `type` properties
- Ensure `cascadeDeleteFromTiers()` function is called

### If version history doesn't save:
- Check that `saveVersion()` is called after operations
- Verify version history state is properly updated
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

### If deleted source indicators don't appear:
- Verify `isCardFromDeletedSource()` function logic
- Check that `isDeletedSource` prop is passed to Card component
- Ensure CSS classes are applied correctly

## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:

1. ‚úÖ Deleting a source item automatically removes all related tier cards
2. ‚úÖ Version history tracks all significant actions
3. ‚úÖ Restoring versions with deleted sources shows proper visual indicators
4. ‚úÖ Deleted source cards are non-functional (no drag, no context menu)
5. ‚úÖ Clear warning messages inform users about deleted source items
6. ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors occur during any operation
