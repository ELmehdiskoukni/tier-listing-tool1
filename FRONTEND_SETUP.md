# Frontend Setup Complete

## What was implemented:

### 1. Axios Setup
- Created `src/api/axios.js` with base URL pointing to `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`
- Added request/response interceptors for logging

### 2. API Helper Functions
- **Projects API** (`src/api/projects.js`): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- **Tiers API** (`src/api/tiers.js`): GET by project, CRUD operations, reorder tiers
- **Cards API** (`src/api/cards.js`): GET by project/tier, CRUD operations, move cards

### 3. React Context for State Management
- **BoardContext** (`src/context/BoardContext.jsx`): Centralized state management
- Handles projects, tiers, cards, loading states, and errors
- Auto-loads projects on mount and board data when project changes

### 4. Project Selector Component
- **ProjectSelector** (`src/components/ProjectSelector.jsx`): UI for selecting/creating projects
- Shows loading states and error handling

### 5. Updated TierBoard Component
- Integrated with BoardContext
- All operations now use API calls instead of local state
- Added loading, error, and no-project-selected states
- Maintains existing functionality (drag & drop, modals, etc.)

## How to use:

1. **Start the backend server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api/v1

## Features:
